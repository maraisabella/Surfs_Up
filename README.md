## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
In this Surf's Up challenge, our objective was find temperature, achieved through the use of performing a weather analysis. W.Avy's wanted us to provide this information in efforts of finding trends in temperature data prior to opening a surf shop. This project intended on helping predict the overall sustainability of the surf and ice cream shop throughout the entire year.
